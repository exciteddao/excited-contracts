## Uninsured Vesting (VestingV1)
1. Owner deploys, specifying number of periods
2. Owner transfers vested token to contract
3. Owner sets vesting start time (lockup), e.g. 6 months from now
4. Owner sets token allowance per investor
5. Once vesting starts, on each tranche (1 month) investors can claim their proportional XCTD allocation
